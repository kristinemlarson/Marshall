Soil Moisture data from the early days of validating GPS interferometric Reflectometry
These are averages from 5 sensors at 2.5 cm and 5 sensors at 7.5 cm.

There were multiple GPS systems at Marshall. P041 is the official one, but to get 
the best data you must download the 1-Hz file. Only this file has L2C in it.

You are also welcome to use data from MFLE, which was installed by our group.
The L2C data are included in it.

There is also a site called LOW3, which has L2C data in it.  This was 
on a tripod, and eventually the site decayed and was replaced with a real monument 
at MFLE.

The L1 data from these systems are not useable for soil moisture.

All GPS data are at UNAVCO
